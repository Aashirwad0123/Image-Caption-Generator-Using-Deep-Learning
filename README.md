# Image-Caption-Generator-Using-Deep-Learning
● Developed an encoder-decoder model using InceptionV3 (CNN) +
LSTM for image captioning.
● Trained on the Flickr8k dataset, achieving a BLEU score of 0.8948.
● Pre-processed text using tokenization, padding, and word
embeddings for NLP tasks.
● Evaluated model performance with loss: 0.3865, accuracy: 88.19%,
and validation accuracy: 26.77%.
● Explored improvements with attention mechanisms and transformer
models.
