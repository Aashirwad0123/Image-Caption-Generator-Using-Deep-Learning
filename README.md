# Image-Caption-Generator-Using-Deep-Learning

● Developed an encoder-decoder model using InceptionV3 (CNN) +
LSTM for image captioning.

● Trained on the Flickr8k dataset, achieving a BLEU score of 0.8948.

● Pre-processed text using tokenization, padding, and word
embeddings for NLP tasks.

● Evaluated model performance with loss: 0.3865, accuracy: 88.19%,
and validation accuracy: 26.77%.

● Explored improvements with attention mechanisms and transformer
models.

● Tools : TensorFlow , Keras , OpenCV , CNN (InceptionV3) , LSTM ,
Word Embeddings , BLEU Score , Python
